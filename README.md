# Gaming-Project---Flappy-Bird-
The game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them. If the player touches the pipes, they lose. Faby briefly flaps upward each time that the player taps the screen; if the screen is not tapped, Faby falls because of gravity; each pair of pipes that he navigates between earns the player a single point, with medals awarded for the score at the end of the game. 

The pygame library is an open-source module for the Python programming language specifically intended to help you make games and other multimedia applications.
COMPONENTS OF PYGAME ARE:

(i)	Game loop and game state
(ii)	Events
(iii)	 Sprites
(iv)	Sound

GAME STATE AND GAME LOOP: Game state is simply a way of referring to a set of values for all the variables in a game program.
Game loop also called as main loop is a loop where the code does three things:
(i)	Handles events.
(ii)	Updates the game state
(iii)	 Draws the game state to the screen

EVENTS: The main loop also has code that updates the game state based on which events have been created.
SPRITES: It includes images.
SOUNDS: It includes sound effects.

# Objective :
The objective is to direct a flying bird, named Faby, who moves continuously to the right between sets of  Mario-like pipes . If the player touches the pipes, they  lose .Faby briefly flaps upward each time that the player taps the screen; if the screen is not tapped, Faby falls because of  gravity ; each pair of pipes that he navigates between earns the player a single  point  with medals awarded for the score at the end of the game.

There is no variation or evolution in gameplay throughout the game, as the pipes always have the same gap between them and there is no end to the running track, having only the flap and ding sounds and the rising score as rewards.
