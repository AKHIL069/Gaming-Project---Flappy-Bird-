# Gaming-Project---Flappy-Bird-
The game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them. If the player touches the pipes, they lose. Faby briefly flaps upward each time that the player taps the screen; if the screen is not tapped, Faby falls because of gravity; each pair of pipes that he navigates between earns the player a single point, with medals awarded for the score at the end of the game.
